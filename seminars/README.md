# Seminars

Due to the shift of the course toward a more practical approach, many of these topics do not have scientific papers as starting points, but I believe technical seminars on them would be interesting. However, I still expect a technical/scientific focus on the topics, not just a "marketing" talk like many we often see. I expect a clear description of the involved concepts, a critical analysis of pros and cons, etc.  

Below is a list of topics. Each graduate/isolated enrollment student must choose a topic and write their name at the end of the line to reserve it. The presentation dates will be indicated on each line once they are defined.  

1. **TensorFlow.**

2. **Cassandra** (important databases in big data, the focus should be on their implementation, as discussed in the papers).
